In The Loop
    There are three types of loop which include: forloop, while-loop,do-while loop.

    FORLOOP: A forloop includes initialization, condition and iteration.
A counter, which is initialized with a certain value — this is the starting point of the loop
 ("Start: I have no food", above).

An exit condition, which is the criteria under which the loop stops — usually
 the counter reaching a certain value. 

An iterator, which generally increments the counter by a small amount on 
each successive loop, until it reaches the exit condition.

It can be represented as shown below: for(var starts = 0; starts <= stop.length; starts++){ //conditions to run }
Note: starts is a variable and stop is more like box for storing data.

WHILE-LOOP: This works in a very similar way to the for loop, except that the initializer variable 
is set before the loop, and the final-expression is included inside the loop after the code to run — 
rather than these two items being included inside the parentheses. The exit-condition is included inside the
 parentheses, which are preceded by the while keyword rather than for.

The same three items are still present, and they are still defined 
in the same order as they are in the for loop — this makes sense, as you still have 
to have an initializer defined before you can check whether it has reached the exit-condition; 
the final-condition is then run after the code inside the loop has run (an iteration has been completed),
 which will only happen if the exit-condition has still not been reached.

 It can be represented as shown thus:
  var starts = 0;
  while (i < stop.length) {
  //condition to run
   starts++;
}

DO-WHILE-LOOP: The major difference between this loop and the other two is that, the code runs first before checking
the condition and stop. It only continues again if the condition is true. It is also preceded with a do keyword.
It can be represented thus:
var starts = 0;

do {
  //condition to run

  i++;
} while (starts < stop.length);
